                <h1>About This Project</h1>
                
                <p>The AI Governance Digital Garden is a curated collection of the best content about AI Governance from around the world. This project aims to aggregate, organize, and present high-quality information from diverse sources and in multiple languages.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                
                <p>As artificial intelligence continues to transform our world, the governance of these technologies becomes increasingly important. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in understanding the evolving landscape of AI governance, from policy developments to ethical frameworks and regulatory approaches.</p>
                
                <h2>Content Sources</h2>
                
                <p>We monitor and curate content from five main categories of sources:</p>
                
                <h3>Journalism</h3>
                <p>Leading publications and journalists covering AI governance, including technology-focused outlets and mainstream media with dedicated AI coverage.</p>
                
                <h3>International Organizations</h3>
                <p>Content from organizations like the UN, UNESCO, OECD, World Economic Forum, and other international bodies working on AI governance frameworks.</p>
                
                <h3>NGOs</h3>
                <p>Non-governmental organizations focused on AI ethics, policy, and governance issues, providing important civil society perspectives.</p>
                
                <h3>Government</h3>
                <p>Official publications, policy documents, and regulatory frameworks from governments around the world.</p>
                
                <h3>Academic</h3>
                <p>Research papers, articles, and analyses from academic institutions and research centers specializing in AI governance.</p>
                
                <h2>Languages</h2>
                
                <p>We curate content in multiple languages to provide a truly global perspective on AI governance:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>English (American, British, Canadian variants)</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                
                <p>This digital garden is powered by an automated system that:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Monitors RSS feeds from hundreds of sources across multiple languages</li>
                    <li>Filters content specifically related to AI governance using advanced keyword matching</li>
                    <li>Prepares content for human review in a staging area</li>
                    <li>Imports approved content into Obsidian for organization and annotation</li>
                    <li>Publishes the curated content to this digital garden website</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Every piece of content is reviewed by a human editor before publication to ensure quality and relevance.</p>
                
                <h2>Using This Site</h2>
                
                <h3>Tag-Based Navigation</h3>
                <p>The primary way to explore content is through tags. Click on any tag to filter the content by that topic. You can select multiple tags to narrow your focus to specific areas of interest.</p>
                
                <h3>Highlighted Key Points</h3>
                <p>Each article includes highlighted key points to help you quickly identify the most important information. You can toggle highlights on or off using the control at the top of the article list.</p>
